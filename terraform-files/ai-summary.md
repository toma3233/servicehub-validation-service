## File Details
    
### /terraform-files/terraform.tfstate
This document is a Terraform state file, which contains information about the current state of infrastructure managed by Terraform. It includes details about resources such as Azure AD applications, Azure DevOps projects, service connections, key vaults, and role assignments. The file also includes sensitive data like project and read personal access tokens (PATs), which are redacted for security. It lists various managed and data resources along with their attributes and dependencies.

### /terraform-files/variables.tf
This Terraform file defines several variables used for configuring Azure DevOps and Azure resources. It includes default values for organization URL, project name, repository name, pipeline path, application name, service tree ID, service connection name, key vault name, key vault resource group name, and subscription IDs. These variables facilitate the setup and management of Azure resources and DevOps configurations.

### /terraform-files/main.tf
This Terraform configuration file sets up resources for Azure DevOps and Azure Active Directory. It configures providers for Azure DevOps, AzureRM, and AzureAD. The script creates an Azure DevOps project with a Git repository, variable group, and two build pipelines (test and development). It also configures a service principal and assigns necessary roles for managing resources, including key vault access. Additionally, it sets up a service connection endpoint for pipeline authentication using workload identity federation.

### /terraform-files/.terraform.lock.hcl
This is a Terraform lock file automatically generated by the 'terraform init' command. It specifies the versions and hashes of providers used in a Terraform project, ensuring consistent provider versions across different environments. The file lists providers such as 'azuread', 'azurerm', and 'azuredevops' with their respective versions and integrity hashes.

### /terraform-files/outputs.tf
This Terraform configuration file defines several outputs related to an Azure DevOps setup. It includes outputs for the repository URL, project name, repository name, service connection name, and sensitive personal access tokens (PATs) for project and read access.
