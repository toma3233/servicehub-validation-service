## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/resources/template-ServiceResources.Parameters.json
This document is a JSON template file used for Azure deployment parameters. It defines parameters such as resourcesName, subscriptionId, location, and resourceGroupName, which are placeholders for actual values to be filled during deployment.

### /basicservice/server/resources/Makefile
This Makefile defines targets for managing alert rules and cleaning up specific files in a project. The 'alertrules' target runs a script to deploy Azure resources for alert rules, while the 'clean' target deletes '.bicep' files in directories containing a specific template file.

### /basicservice/server/resources/deployAzureResources.sh
This is a Bash script for deploying Azure resources using Bicep templates. It iterates over Bicep files in a specified directory, deploying each one asynchronously. The script checks the deployment status and optionally saves the outputs if specified. It handles provisioning state checks and output saving, including invoking another script for further processing if required.
