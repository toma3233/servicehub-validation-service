# AI-Summary
## Directory Summary
This directory contains Go source and test files for the 'demoserver' package, which is part of a larger gRPC service project. It includes implementations for server methods, server setup with options, and behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Ginkgo and Gomega. Some files are autogenerated, providing server setup and logging capabilities.

**Tags:** Go, demoserver, gRPC, server, testing

## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/SayHello.go
The Go file defines a method `SayHello` for the `Server` struct in the `demoserver` package. This method takes a context and a `HelloRequest` as input and returns a `HelloReply` and an error. It logs the request, simulates processing with a sleep, and returns a message echoing the input name, age, and email.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/api.go
The `api.go` file in the `demoserver` package defines a `Server` struct that embeds the `UnimplementedBasicServiceServer` from a protobuf-generated file. This setup allows the struct to use default implementations from the protobuf unless overridden. The file includes a `NewServer` function that returns a new instance of `Server` and an `init` method that takes `Options` as input. This file is part of a larger Go service project, as indicated by the repository list.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/options.go
This Go file defines a struct named 'Options' with two fields: 'Port' of type int and 'JsonLog' of type bool. The file is marked as auto-generated but can be modified.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver.go
This Go file is an auto-generated server implementation for a gRPC service. It sets up a gRPC server with logging capabilities and listens on a specified port. The server is configured using options that determine the logging format (either text or JSON).

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver_suite_test.go
This Go test file is part of the 'demoserver' package and sets up a test suite using Ginkgo and Gomega for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing. The 'TestDemoserver' function registers a fail handler and runs the specs for the 'Demoserver Suite'.
