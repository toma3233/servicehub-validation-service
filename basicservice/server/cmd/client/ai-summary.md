## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/cmd/client/main.go
This Go file is an auto-generated command-line interface (CLI) application using the Cobra library. It defines a root command for the 'BasicService' application, providing a structure for adding subcommands and executing them. The main function calls Execute to run the command.

### /basicservice/server/cmd/client/client_suite_test.go
This Go test file, `client_suite_test.go`, is part of a test suite for the client component in a server application. It uses the Ginkgo testing framework to define a suite of tests for the client, registering a failure handler and running the test specifications.

### /basicservice/server/cmd/client/client_test.go
This Go test file uses the Ginkgo testing framework to test a Cobra command called 'hello'. The tests verify that the command logs the correct response or error message when executed, depending on whether a valid or invalid server address is provided.

### /basicservice/server/cmd/client/start.go
This Go code defines a command-line client application that connects to a remote server to send a 'Hello' request using gRPC and REST APIs. The application uses the Cobra library for command-line interface management and supports various flags for configuration such as remote server address, HTTP address, and user details like name, age, email, and address. The 'hello' function is the main command handler that initializes logging, sets up a client, and repeatedly sends 'Hello' requests based on the interval specified. The 'SayHello' function sends a request to the server and logs the response.
