**Tags:** Dockerfile, Go, multi-stage build, Kubernetes, deployment

## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/Dockerfile_workspace
This Dockerfile sets up a multi-stage build for a Go-based service. It uses a Go image for building and an OpenJDK image for the final runtime. The build stage compiles several Go binaries from a specified Azure DevOps repository. The final image includes these binaries and runs the server binary by default.

### /basicservice/server/Dockerfile
This Dockerfile is used to build a Go-based server application in a multi-stage process. The first stage compiles Go applications from the source code in the repository using a Go image. It configures git and Go modules, and builds three executables: client, demoserver, and server. The second stage copies these executables into an OpenJDK image for deployment.

### /basicservice/server/Makefile
This Makefile is part of the 'basicservice' directory and is used to manage various tasks related to building, testing, deploying, and managing Docker images and Kubernetes resources for a service. It includes targets for tidying Go modules, running tests, building binaries, deploying resources, and managing Docker and Kubernetes operations. It also handles templating server files using a specified config file.
