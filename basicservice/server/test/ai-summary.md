## Directory Summary
This directory contains various Bash scripts for automating tasks related to the development and deployment of a Go-based server service. The scripts handle tasks such as test suite creation, build and test automation, Docker image building and pushing, Kubernetes pod monitoring, and resource provisioning. These scripts are designed to streamline the development process and ensure consistent deployment and testing practices.

**Tags:** Bash script, Go, automation, Kubernetes, Docker

## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/test/testSuites.sh
The script is a Bash script designed to create test suites for Go files in a repository. It installs the Ginkgo testing framework and checks each directory under the current repository for Go files. If Go files are found without corresponding test suites, the script attempts to generate test suites using Ginkgo. The script is intended to be run locally and will fail in a PR pipeline if test suites are missing, prompting the user to create them manually.

### /basicservice/server/test/testServiceImage.sh
This is a Bash script designed to automate the build and test process of a server module. It sets up Git configuration, builds the server module using Go, and runs tests. If the build or tests fail, it outputs an error message in red and exits with a non-zero status. If successful, it outputs a success message in green.

### /basicservice/server/test/testCoverageOutput.sh
This Bash script is used to automate the testing and coverage reporting process for a Go-based service. It sets up environment configurations, installs necessary tools, and executes tests using Ginkgo, a Go testing framework. The script generates a coverage report, compares the coverage percentage to a specified threshold, and outputs the result, indicating whether it meets the required coverage level.

### /basicservice/server/test/provisionServiceResources.sh
This is a shell script used for provisioning service-specific resources in a server environment. It navigates to the 'basicservice/server' directory and executes the 'make deploy-resources' command. The script checks the success of the provisioning and prints colored messages indicating whether the process was successful or failed.

### /basicservice/server/test/checkServicePodLogs.sh
This is a Bash script designed to monitor Kubernetes pod logs for specific messages within a specified timeout period. The script checks for the presence of the strings '"msg":"finished call"' and '"code":"OK"' in the logs of pods within given namespaces. If these strings are not found within 150 seconds, it reports a timeout error.

### /basicservice/server/test/buildImage.sh
This Bash script is used to build a Docker image for a service located in the 'basicservice/server' directory. It checks if the environment variable 'WORKSPACE' is set to 'true' to determine whether to build a workspace image or a regular image using 'make'. It provides colored output messages to indicate success or failure of the build process.

### /basicservice/server/test/deployService.sh
This Bash script, `deployService.sh`, is used to automate the deployment of a service within the `basicservice/server` directory. It includes steps for installing the service, checking the status of service pods, and verifying logs to ensure successful deployment. It uses color-coded messages to indicate success or failure in the deployment process.

### /basicservice/server/test/checkServicePodStatus.sh
This bash script checks the status of pods within specified Kubernetes namespaces. It verifies if the namespaces exist and if all pods within those namespaces are running and ready. The script loops through a list of predefined namespaces and uses kubectl commands to perform these checks, exiting with an error if any issues are detected.

### /basicservice/server/test/pushImage.sh
This is a Bash script for pushing a Docker image. It navigates to the 'basicservice/server' directory and uses 'make push-image' to push the Docker image. The script checks if the operation was successful and prints a success or failure message accordingly.
