## File Details
    
### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client.go
This Go file defines a package named 'client' which provides a function 'NewClient'. This function creates and returns a gRPC client for the 'BasicService' with registered interceptors. It takes a remote address and interceptor options as inputs and returns a 'BasicServiceClient' and an error as outputs. The function uses insecure transport credentials for the connection and logs errors if the connection fails.

### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client_suite_test.go
This Go test file sets up a test suite for the client package using Ginkgo and Gomega. It registers a fail handler and runs the test specifications for the 'Client Suite'.

### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client_test.go
This Go test file contains unit tests for a client in the `client` package. It uses the Ginkgo and Gomega libraries for testing. The tests verify that a new client can be created with a valid address and that an error is returned for an invalid address.
