## File Details
    
### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/client.go
This Go file is a generated client for interacting with an API, created using Swagger Codegen. It includes the APIClient struct which manages communication with the API and contains methods for preparing and executing HTTP requests, setting headers, and handling authentication. The file also provides utility functions for type checking, parameter conversion, and content type detection.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/model_hello_reply.go
This Go file defines a struct named HelloReply in the restsdk package, which includes a single field, Message, of type string. The file is generated by Swagger Codegen as indicated in the comments.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/.swagger-codegen-ignore
The document is a .swagger-codegen-ignore file that specifies files and directories to be ignored by the Swagger code generation tool. It lists .travis.yml and all files within the docs/ directory to be ignored.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/response.go
This Go file is part of a generated codebase by Swagger Codegen. It defines a package named 'restsdk' containing a struct 'APIResponse' that encapsulates HTTP response details. The struct includes fields for the HTTP response, message, operation name, request URL, method, and payload. Two functions are provided: 'NewAPIResponse' which initializes an APIResponse with an HTTP response, and 'NewAPIResponseWithError' which initializes it with an error message.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/api_basic_service.go
This Go file is part of a REST SDK and contains a function generated by Swagger Codegen for sending greetings via an HTTP POST request. The function `BasicServiceSayHello` takes a context and a `HelloRequest` as input and returns a `HelloReply`, an HTTP response, and an error if any. This function is part of the `BasicServiceApiService` and interacts with an API endpoint at `/v1/hello`.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/git_push.sh
This script is a shell script designed to automate the process of adding an existing project to a GitHub repository. It initializes a local directory as a Git repository, stages and commits all changes, sets a remote GitHub repository, and pushes the changes. The script accepts three optional command-line arguments: GitHub user ID, repository ID, and release note.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/configuration.go
This Go file, generated by Swagger Codegen, defines a package for handling REST SDK configuration. It includes context keys for various authentication methods, such as OAuth2, BasicAuth, AccessToken, and APIKey. The file also defines a BasicAuth struct for basic HTTP authentication and an APIKey struct for API key authentication. A Configuration struct is provided for setting up base path, host, scheme, headers, user agent, and HTTP client. The NewConfiguration function initializes a Configuration instance with default values, and the AddDefaultHeader method allows adding headers to the configuration.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/model_address.go
This file defines a Go struct named 'Address' with fields for City, State, Zipcode, and Street, used for representing address information. The file is generated by Swagger Codegen.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/model_rpc_status.go
This Go file defines a struct named RpcStatus in the 'restsdk' package. It includes fields for 'Code', 'Message', and 'Details', which are used to represent the status of an RPC call. The file is generated by Swagger Codegen.

### /basicservice/api/v1/restsdk/model_hello_request.go
This Go file defines a struct named `HelloRequest` in the `restsdk` package. The struct includes fields for `Name`, `Age`, `Email`, and an optional `Address`. The file is generated by Swagger Codegen.
