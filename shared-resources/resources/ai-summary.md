### /shared-resources/resources/testResourceNames.sh

It checks the length of resource group names to ensure they do not exceed Azure's maximum length restrictions, and adjusts names based on parameters and configurations. The script uses JSON files to retrieve parameters and employs the Azure CLI and jq tool for JSON processing.

This document is a JSON file that defines parameters for an Azure deployment template. It includes placeholders for resourcesName, subscriptionId, location, and resourceGroupName.

This Bicep template file is used to deploy various Azure resources at the subscription level, including a resource group, AKS managed cluster, container registry, operational insights workspace, data collection rule, and a service bus namespace. It takes parameters such as resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name to configure the deployments.
