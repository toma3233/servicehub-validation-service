The directory also features a state file detailing its structure and contents.

**Tags:** Azure, Bash script, resource provisioning, pipeline, shared resources

## File Details
    
### /shared-resources/deleteResourceGroup.sh
This is a Bash script that deletes an Azure resource group. The script takes a resource group name as an argument, navigates to the 'shared-resources' directory, and deletes the specified resource group using the Azure CLI. It provides feedback on whether the deletion was successful or failed.

### /shared-resources/provisionSharedResourcesPipeline.yaml
This YAML file is a pipeline configuration for deploying shared resources using Azure CLI and Bash scripts. It includes steps to deploy resources, log resource group links, and publish markdown files related to shared resources. The deployment uses a Bash script located at 'shared-resources/provisionSharedResources.sh', and logs are generated for resource group links if a specific output file exists. It also publishes markdown files as pipeline artifacts.

### /shared-resources/provisionSharedResources.sh
This is a Bash script for provisioning shared resources. It changes the directory to 'shared-resources' and executes 'make deploy-resources'. If the deployment fails, it exits with an error message. If successful, it prints a success message.

### /shared-resources/Makefile
This Makefile is designed to automate the process of templating and deploying shared resources using Docker and Azure CLI. It includes two main tasks: `template-files`, which generates files from templates using a Docker container, and `deploy-resources`, which provisions resources in Azure using a Bicep template and parameters file. The Makefile assumes the presence of a configuration file, `env-config.yaml`, in the main directory.

### /shared-resources/.state.txt
This document is a state file listing the directory structure and files within a project related to shared resources and configurations for different environments such as production and test. The files include configuration JSON files, parameter files, templates, scripts, and YAML configuration files for pipelines.

### /shared-resources/OneBranch.Official.Release.yml
This YAML file is a configuration for a OneBranch pipeline, designed for managing release processes. It includes parameters for different rollout types (normal, emergency, globaloutage), and allows for the override of managed validation duration. The pipeline is set to trigger manually and references external templates and resources for its execution. It extends a template for cross-platform rollout and defines a production stage for managed SDP rollout.
