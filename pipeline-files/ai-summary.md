These files facilitate deployment processes, resource provisioning, and service management within production environments.

**Tags:** pipeline, YAML, build, deployment, OneBranch, Azure DevOps

## File Details
    
### /pipeline-files/OneBranch.Official.Release.Example.yml
This YAML file is a pipeline configuration for OneBranch's release process. It includes parameters for rollout type, validation duration, and incident ID. It also specifies resources like repositories and pipelines, and extends a template for cross-platform rollout configurations. The pipeline is set up to manage deployments in production environments with specific job steps for managed SDP rollouts.

### /pipeline-files/buildEv2Artifacts.sh
This shell script, `buildEv2Artifacts.sh`, is designed to create artifact files for a deployment process. It handles both service-specific and shared resource builds, depending on the `isService` flag. The script copies necessary files, tests services, builds Docker images, packages Helm charts, and processes Bicep files. It also checks for and installs Helm if needed, and manages build versioning.

### /pipeline-files/OneBranch.Official.Build.yml
This YAML file is a build pipeline configuration for services or shared resources, using OneBranch Pipelines. It includes variables for directory names, service identification, rollout infrastructure, and credential provider settings. The pipeline is structured to support variable groups and includes stages for building service images and preparing artifacts. It references external templates and resources, and is designed to handle both service and shared resource builds.

### /pipeline-files/.state.txt
The document lists pipeline files related to a build and release process, including YAML and shell script files.

### /pipeline-files/testServiceResourceAndCode.yaml
This YAML file defines an Azure DevOps pipeline for creating, deploying, and deleting resources and services. It consists of two main stages: 'creation_stage' and 'deletion_stage'. The 'creation_stage' generates and publishes environment configuration, provisions shared resources, and deploys services using templates. The 'deletion_stage' deletes the resources based on a condition. It uses Bash scripts and Azure CLI tasks for execution.

### /pipeline-files/downloadRequirements.yaml
This YAML file is a configuration for a pipeline step that downloads an environment configuration artifact named 'EnvConfig' to the system's default working directory.
