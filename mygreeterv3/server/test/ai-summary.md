## Directory Summary
This directory contains various Bash scripts for managing the 'mygreeterv3' server project. The scripts handle tasks such as creating test suites, building and testing server modules, performing test coverage analysis, provisioning resources, checking Kubernetes pod logs and statuses, building and pushing Docker images, and deploying services. These scripts are integral to the project's CI/CD pipeline and resource management.

**Tags:** Bash script, Go, Kubernetes, Docker, deployment, test coverage

## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testSuites.sh
The script is a Bash script designed to create test suites for all directories containing Go files within the repository that currently lack test suites. It installs Ginkgo, a Go testing framework, and iterates through directories to check for Go files and test suites, creating a test suite if none exists. This is part of a PR pipeline process to ensure all Go files have associated tests.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testServiceImage.sh
This is a bash script for building and testing a server module within the 'mygreeterv3' directory. It configures Git with a specific URL using a personal access token, builds the server module using Go, and runs tests on it. If the build or tests fail, it outputs an error message in red; otherwise, it confirms success in green.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testCoverageOutput.sh
This Bash script is used to perform test coverage analysis for the 'mygreeterv3' server project. It sets up the environment by configuring Git and installing necessary Go tools. The script runs tests using the Ginkgo framework, generates a coverage report in HTML format, and checks if the coverage percentage meets a specified threshold. If the coverage is below the threshold, it exits with an error.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/provisionServiceResources.sh
This script is a Bash script used for provisioning service-specific resources for the 'mygreeterv3' server. It navigates to the appropriate directory and executes a make command to deploy resources. If the deployment fails, it outputs an error message in red; otherwise, it confirms success in green.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/checkServicePodLogs.sh
This is a Bash script that checks the logs of Kubernetes pods for specific strings within a specified timeout period. It looks for the strings '"msg":"finished call"' and '"code":"OK"' in the logs of pods in given namespaces. If the logs contain these strings, it prints a success message; otherwise, it exits with an error after the timeout.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/buildImage.sh
This is a shell script for building Docker images for the 'mygreeterv3' server. It checks if the 'WORKSPACE' environment variable is set to 'true' and builds the appropriate Docker image using 'make'. It provides feedback on the success or failure of the build process using colored text output.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/deployService.sh
This is a shell script designed to automate the deployment of a service within the 'mygreeterv3/server' directory. It assumes that resource provisioning has been completed and uses Makefile to install necessary components. The script checks the status of the service pod and its logs to ensure successful deployment, using helper scripts 'checkServicePodStatus.sh' and 'checkServicePodLogs.sh'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/checkServicePodStatus.sh
This bash script checks the status of pods across multiple Kubernetes namespaces. It verifies if the namespaces exist, checks if pods are running, and ensures that all pods are ready. The script exits with an error message if any of these conditions are not met.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/pushImage.sh
This is a Bash script used to navigate to the mygreeterv3 server directory and execute a Makefile target to push a Docker image. It checks if the image push was successful and provides colored output to indicate success or failure.
