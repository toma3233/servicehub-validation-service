## Directory Summary
This directory contains essential files for building and deploying a Go-based application within Docker containers. It includes two Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds using Go and OpenJDK, and a Makefile for managing tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the application, as well as handling Kubernetes and Azure configurations.

**Tags:** Dockerfile, Go, build, deploy, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure

## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/Dockerfile_workspace
This Dockerfile is used to build a Go-based application in two stages. The first stage involves setting up a Go environment, copying source code, configuring Git, and building the Go modules and executables. The second stage involves creating a container image using OpenJDK, where the built executables are copied from the first stage. The final command in the Dockerfile runs the server executable.

### /mygreeterv3/server/Dockerfile
This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for a Go application. It consists of two stages: the first stage uses a Go environment to build the application binaries, and the second stage uses an OpenJDK environment to package the binaries. The Dockerfile configures git for a private repository, runs Go module tidy, and builds three Go applications: client, demoserver, and server. The final image includes these binaries and sets the entry point to '/server'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/Makefile
This Makefile is designed for managing various tasks related to the 'mygreeterv3' server, including building, testing, deploying, and managing resources for a Go-based service. It includes targets for templating files, deploying resources, tidying Go modules, running tests, building binaries, building and pushing Docker images, and installing, upgrading, and uninstalling Helm charts. The file also includes commands for handling Kubernetes configurations and Azure SDK properties.
