**Tags:** Azure, deployment, automation, Bicep templates

## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/template-ServiceResources.Parameters.json
This JSON file is a template for Azure deployment parameters, specifying placeholders for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. It uses the Azure deployment parameters schema from 2019.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/Makefile
This Makefile is part of a project that automates the deployment of Azure resources. It includes targets for deploying alert rules and Azure SDK resources using a script called 'deployAzureResources.sh'. The 'clean' target removes Bicep files if a specific template file is present. The Makefile supports parallel execution of its targets.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/deployAzureResources.sh
This is a Bash script designed to deploy Azure resources using Bicep templates. It takes two arguments: the directory containing Bicep template files and a flag indicating whether to save outputs. The script deploys each Bicep template in the specified directory and saves provisioning outputs if specified. It runs deployments in parallel and checks the success of each process, reporting failures if any occur.
