### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/.method_template_bicep.txt
This document is a Bicep template for setting up alert rules for the 'mygreeterv3' service. It defines parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group names. The template references an existing Log Analytics Workspace and includes modules for setting up alert rules for query per second, error ratio, and latency by error code, with specific criteria and configurations for each alert.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/StartLongRunningOperation.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file defines alert rules for the 'StartLongRunningOperation' service in the 'mygreeterv3' project. It sets up alerts for query-per-second, error-ratio, and latency metrics using Azure Monitor. The template references a shared Log Analytics Workspace and sets parameters for resource naming, subscription ID, location, and resource group. The alert rules are defined with specific thresholds, time aggregations, and evaluation frequencies.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/CreateStorageAccount.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template defines alert rules for monitoring a service named 'mygreeterv3'. It includes parameters for resource naming, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The template references an existing Log Analytics workspace and defines modules for three types of alerts: query per second (QPS), error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert module specifies criteria, thresholds, and other configurations for monitoring the 'CreateStorageAccount' method in the service logs.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/ListResourceGroups.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file defines alert rules for monitoring a service named 'mygreeterv3'. It includes parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The file declares a shared resource for a Log Analytics workspace and defines three alert rules: QPS (queries per second), error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert rule specifies criteria for triggering alerts based on metrics such as QPS, error ratio, and latency, with specific thresholds and time aggregations.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/DeleteResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep file defines alert rules for monitoring the 'DeleteResourceGroup' method in the 'mygreeterv3' service. It includes parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The file references a shared Log Analytics workspace and defines three alert modules for query per second, error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert module specifies criteria, threshold, time aggregation, and other parameters for monitoring and alerting purposes.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/ReadResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template defines alert rules for the 'mygreeterv3' service, specifically for the 'ReadResourceGroup' method. It sets up three alert modules: 'qpsAlertRule' for query per second, 'errorRatioAlertRule' for error ratio, and 'latencyAlertRule' for latency by error code. Each module specifies parameters like location, alert description, criteria, and thresholds for triggering alerts. The template references an existing Log Analytics Workspace and uses it as the scope for the alerts.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/DeleteStorageAccount.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template defines alert rules for monitoring the 'DeleteStorageAccount' method in the 'mygreeterv3' service. It specifies parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group. The template references an existing Log Analytics workspace and sets up three alert modules: query-per-second, error-ratio, and latency-by-error-code, each with specific criteria, thresholds, and configurations for alerts.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/UpdateResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template is used for setting up alert rules for a service named 'mygreeterv3'. It defines parameters for resource configuration, such as the resource name, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The template includes modules for setting up query-per-second, error ratio, and latency alert rules using Azure Monitor's scheduled-query-rule resource. These rules monitor metrics like QPS, error ratio, and latency with specified thresholds and conditions.
