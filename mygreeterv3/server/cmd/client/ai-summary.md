## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/client/main.go
This Go file is an auto-generated command-line client application for a gRPC service. It uses the Cobra library to handle command-line arguments and executes the root command defined in the application. The application is named 'MyGreeter' and demonstrates client-server communication using gRPC and interactions with the Azure SDK.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/client/client_suite_test.go
This Go test file uses the Ginkgo and Gomega testing frameworks to define a test suite for a client. The function TestClient registers a fail handler and runs the test specifications for the 'Client Suite'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/client/client_test.go
This Go test file uses Ginkgo and Gomega to test a Cobra command client for a server. It includes tests to check the execution of the command and the logging of responses or errors.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/client/start.go
This Go script is a command-line client that communicates with a remote server using gRPC. It includes a command 'hello' that sends a 'SayHello' request to the server with user-provided options such as name, age, email, and address.
