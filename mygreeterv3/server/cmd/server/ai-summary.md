## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/server/main.go
This Go code file contains an auto-generated main program for a command-line application called 'MyGreeter'. It uses the Cobra library to set up a root command that provides a description of the service, which demonstrates client-server communication using gRPC and interacts with the Azure SDK. The main function calls the Execute function, which runs the root command.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/server/server_suite_test.go
This Go test file is part of a server suite and uses the Ginkgo and Gomega libraries for behavior-driven development (BDD) style testing. It includes a test function `TestServer` which registers a fail handler and runs the specs for the 'Server Suite'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/server/start.go
This Go file is an auto-generated command-line tool using the Cobra library. It defines a 'start' command for starting a service, with various configurable options such as port numbers, logging format, subscription ID, and more. The command executes the 'start' function, which calls 'server.Serve' with the specified options.
