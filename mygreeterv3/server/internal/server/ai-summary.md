It logs errors and information using a context logger.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/ReadStorageAccount.go
This Go file defines a method `ReadStorageAccount` for a server package that reads properties of a storage account using Azure's SDK. It takes a context and a request for reading a storage account as inputs and returns a response containing storage account details or an error. The method logs errors and handles situations where the AccountsClient is not initialized.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/ListStorageAccounts.go
This Go file defines a method `ListStorageAccounts` in the `Server` struct, which retrieves and returns a list of Azure storage accounts within a specified resource group. It uses Azure SDK's storage account pager to iterate through the accounts and returns them in a gRPC response format.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/api.go
The file defines a Go server for the MyGreeter service, integrating Azure SDKs and Service Bus. It includes a Server struct with clients for Azure Resource Groups, Storage Accounts, and Service Bus. The server initialization function sets up logging, Azure SDK credentials, and Service Bus connections based on provided options.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/DeleteResourceGroup.go
The Go file DeleteResourceGroup.go defines a method DeleteResourceGroup for the Server struct, which handles the deletion of a resource group using a ResourceGroupClient. It logs errors and returns an empty protobuf message on completion. It uses gRPC status codes and Azure SDK features.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/server.go
The file is an auto-generated Go server code for managing a gRPC server and a gRPC-Gateway. It includes functions to start the server, check if the server is running, and handle errors. The main function 'Serve' initializes and starts the gRPC server and the HTTP server for the gRPC-Gateway, registering necessary services and health checks.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/CreateResourceGroup.go
This Go file defines a function `CreateResourceGroup` within the `server` package. The function takes a context and a `CreateResourceGroupRequest` as inputs, and returns an empty protobuf message and an error. It uses Azure SDKs to create or update a resource group in a specified region, logging the process and handling errors appropriately.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/DeleteStorageAccount.go
