## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/SayHello.go
This Go code file contains the implementation of the SayHello function for a demo server. The function takes a context and a HelloRequest message as input and returns a HelloReply message and an error. It logs the request details and simulates a delay before responding with a message that echoes the input request details. The function also handles a special case where it panics if the input name is 'TestPanic'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/api.go
This Go file defines a Server struct that embeds the UnimplementedMyGreeterServer from a protobuf definition, allowing it to use or override generated methods. It includes a NewServer function to create a new Server instance and an init method that takes an Options parameter.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/options.go
The file `options.go` is an auto-generated Go code file that defines a struct named `Options` with two fields: `Port` of type `int` and `JsonLog` of type `bool`. This struct is part of the `demoserver` package.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver.go
The file 'demoserver.go' is an auto-generated Go server script for setting up a gRPC server. It includes functionality to initialize and start the server with logging capabilities. The server listens on a specified port and handles gRPC requests using interceptors for logging. The script is not intended to be modified as it is auto-generated.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver_suite_test.go
This Go test file is part of the 'demoserver' package and uses the Ginkgo and Gomega testing frameworks to set up a test suite for the Demoserver. It registers a fail handler and runs the specs for the suite.
